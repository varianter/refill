I think there is more to it, which is why I will spend this opening Keynote giving advice on attending a conference with intent. I will suggest how to get the most out of the talks to come, how to network meaningfully, and how to apply what you learn. Coincidentally, doing all of this will be practicing many of the same behaviours you would employ to have more impact at work. See how that ties into the theme for the conference? Clever, if I say so myself.",

You are relying on the fact that the dependencies you are mocking will never change, which makes the test code brittle.
